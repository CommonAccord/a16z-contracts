1.2.Ti=Modifications and Derivative Works

1.2.1.sec=We understand that you may want to create derivative works of the {_NFT_Media} (“{_Your_NFT_Media_Derivatives.Target}”) and we allow you to do so under the scope of the license granted above. However, you acknowledge and agree that (a) the subsequent lawful owner of the {_Project_NFT} may create its own derivatives of the {_NFT_Media} and (b) other owners of their own {_Project_NFT}s and the associated artwork, images, video, content or other works of authorship linked to such {_Project_NFT} (“{_Other_Project_NFT_Media.Target}”) may also create their own derivatives of the {_Other_Project_NFT_Media} (each of them “{_Other_NFT_Media_Derivatives.Target}”).


1.2.2.sec=These {_Other_NFT_Media_Derivatives} may be similar or identical to {_Your_NFT_Media_Derivatives}. Accordingly, on behalf of yourself and your heirs, successors and assigns, you irrevocably covenant and agree not to assert or bring any suit, claim, demand or challenge against (a) {_Creator} or its past, present and future parents, affiliates or licensees (or any of their partners, members, employees, officers, directors, contractors, agents and equityholders) in connection with their use, distribution, reproduction, display, perform, modification, and creation of derivative works of any {_NFT_Media} prior to the grant of this license or any of their own {_Other_NFT_Media_Derivatives} or (b) any other {_Project_NFT} owner or its past, present and future parents, affiliates or licensees (or any of their partners, members, employees, officers, directors, contractors, agents and equityholders) in connection with the use, distribution, reproduction, display, perform, modification, and creation of derivative works of the {_Other_Project_NFT_Media} or any of their {_Other_NFT_Media_Derivatives}.
