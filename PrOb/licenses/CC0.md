Ti=“CAN’T BE EVIL”<br>NFT LICENSE CC0 (“CBE-CC0”)

CodersNotes=The CC0 Agreement is referenced with a link in Section 1.1 and somewhat differently in Section 2.2.  Is that necessary?  Lawyers note - In Section 1.2, the "if the age of lawfully capacity" (a) reads oddly and (b) textually the "if" could be construed to modify all that comes before it (including the 18 year requirement). "{_Restricted_Parties}" is defined but not otherwise used. In Section 0 - "we" and "us" are defined, but not used. Note also that "you" and "your" are used but not defined. We have transcluded most of Section 1.3 from the equivalent at ECR 2.5. In 1.3.3.sec (ECR.2.5.3.sec), "creator" is used in uncapitalized form, we have parametrized and capitalized it. In Section 1.3.2 (ECR.2.5.2), "Template Provider Entities" is defined but not otherwise used.

CodersNote=The organization of this CC0 is in 2 Sections, while the other licenses are organized in 3 Sections. The difference is that in this CC0 license, the "Disclaimers" Section (# 2 in the other licenses) is included in the "Grant" Section (# 1) as Section 1.3.  It could be renumbered as Section 2, which would make it parallel the other licenses.  

Intro.sec=By acquiring lawful ownership to a non-fungible token (“{_NFT.Target}”) associated with the {_NFT} project made available under this {_NFT} License (“{_Project_NFT.Target}”) created by the owner or entity that has created this {_Project_NFT} (“{_Creator.Target}” or “we” or “our”) or by using, distributing, reproducing, displaying, performing, modifying, or creating derivative works of any associated artwork, images, video, content or other works of authorship linked to a specific {_Project_NFT} which was developed by {_Creator} (the “{_NFT_Media.Target}”), you agree to these {_NFT} License Terms and Conditions (the “{_Terms.Target}”). When you lawfully own a {_Project_NFT}, you own all personal property rights to the {_NFT} underlying the {_Project_NFT} (e.g., the right to freely sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of that {_Project_NFT}). However, your rights to the {_NFT_Media} are only as outlined below.
