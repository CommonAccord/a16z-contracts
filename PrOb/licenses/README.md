This is a restatement of the Licences from https://github.com/a16z/a16z-contracts/tree/master/arweave_upload/licenses, which are in PDF format.

These are restated in ProseObject format.  They deduplicate very large portions of the text of the various licenses by using one license (ECR.md) as a base and expressing the other licenses as differences on the base.  

This also parameterizes the Defined Terms so that they link to the definitions.

It does not yet link the cross-references, but we will do that.  

There are a number of questions or anamolies in the various texts that are noted in the source view of the .md files.  These could be re-expressed as GitHub "Issues".
